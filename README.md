# reservation
A simple reservation system program for a very small plane.

A very early program in the intro C class that mostly uses arrays and switch cases to get the job done. A vulnerable program based on user inputs, is not robust since it relies on honest cooperation from the user and the scanf function. The program is a good introduction to your basic indexing and tracking with a small 1d array. 

5/7 would not ride this plane again, its very leaky.

For Portfolio use.
